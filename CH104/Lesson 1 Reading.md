### 1.1 What is Chemistry?

**Chemistry** The study of matter, what it consists of, and what its properties are, and how it changes

**Matter**- is anything that has mass and takes up space
* anything physical or real

**Science**- the process by which we learn about the natural universe by observing, testing, and generating models that explain our observations

**Scientific Method**- the process which scientists follow for their work to be held to an acceptable standard
1. **Propose a Hypothesis**- A testable idea
2. **Test the Hypothesis**- Carrying out an experiment to test your hypothesis
3. **Refine Hypothesis**- Change your hypothesis because of the results of the testing

### The Classification of Matter

**Physical Properties**- characteristics that describe matter
* size
* shape
* color
* mass

**Chemical Properties**- Characteristics of how matter changes its chemical structure or composition
* Flammability/combustion

**Substance**- any sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout

Two types of Substances
1. **Element**- A substance that cannot be broken down into chemically simpler components.
2. **Compound**- A substance that can be broken down into chemically simpler components
	* Chemically combined

##### Mixtures

**Mixture**- any material composed of two or more substances
* the substances maintain their chemical identities

**Heterogeneous Mixtures**- obvious combinations of multiple substances
* water and sand

**Homogeneous Mixtures**- Act as a single substance, adding more of it does not change the properties
* Sugar dissolving in water


##### Phases

**Phases**- the physical state of the matter
* solid
	* definite shape
	* definite volume
* liquid
	* No definite shape
	* Have a definite volume
* gas
	* no definite shape
	* no definite volume
* aqueous

**Phase Change**- A physical process in which a substance goes from one phase to another
* liquid-> solid

| Change           |   Name                   |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| Solid to Liquid  |      melting, fusion     |
|   solid to gas   |       sublimation        |
|  liquid to gas   |   boiling, evaporation   |
| liquid to solid  | solidification, freezing |
| gas to liquid    |     condensation         |
| gas to solid     |        deposition        |
