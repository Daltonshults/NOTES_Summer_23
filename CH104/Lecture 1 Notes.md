### To Succeed
* Ideas are abstract and this makes it difficult
* Pre-requisite is MTH 95
* Work through the homework problems
	* Make sure that you understand them
	* Read a problem and recognize what kind of problem it is and solving it.
	* Quiz problems will be like the homework problems
		* Same types of questions
	* Problems you struggle with, try to understand where you are making errors

COCC has free tutoring
* Do they have it over the summer?

# Classification of Matter

Chemistry- The study of matter
* The central science
	* You need to understand the makeup of things to understand other sciences; Biology for example

**Matter**- Something that has mass and occupies space
* A physical something

**Pure Substance**- A substance that cannot be separated into other kinds of matter by physical processes such as filtering or evaporating and is either an element or a compound

**Compound**- Made up of two or more elements that are chemically combined.

**Elements**- Cannot be separated into simpler substances even with a chemical reaction

**Mixtures**- Can be separated by physical means, made up of two or more substances

**Homogeneous Mixtures**- Mixtures that have the same composition throughout
* Salt water

**Heterogeneous Mixtures**- Those that do not have the same chemical composition throughout
* Salad dressing

118 Known Elements in the Universe

Formulas- First letter capitalized and the second letter lower case

Water is seen in all three states


A mixture can be separated by a physical process
* Like filtering
* Distillation

Separating a mixture
* Can use chromatography

### Physical Property of Matter
* color
* odor
* melting point
* boiling point
* state at 25Â°
* luster
* conduction of electricity 
* conduction of heat

### Chemical Properties of Matter- How does it react?
* Flammability
* Toxicity
* Reactivity w/ water


### Change of State
* **Melting**- from solid to liquid
* **Freezing**- from liquid to solid
* **Vaporization**- from liquid to gas
* **Condensation**- from gas to liquid
* **Sublimation**- from solid to gas
* **Deposition**- from gas to solid
