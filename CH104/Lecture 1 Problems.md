### Section 1.2
1. Consider the table in the model above. How does the formula of an element differ from that of a compound?
	* Elements are made up of a single atom
	* Compounds are made up of multiple atoms, or are a combination of elements


2. How can you distinguish elements from compounds based on their chemical formulas? 
	* You see if there are two substances, or a singular type of atom within the formula. For example H<sub>2</sub> is an element but H<sub>2</sub>O is a compound. H vs H<sub>2</sub>O 


3. How does a pure substance (i.e., element or compound) differ from a mixture? Describe. 
	* Solutions are made from multiple substances
		* Element -> Compound -> Solution
	* If you add more water to water it doesn't change
	* If you add more salt to salt water it changes the properties

4. Hypothesize on the meaning of the labels (s), (l), (g), and (aq) on the formulas.
	* solid
	* liquid
	* gas
	* aqueous- Dissolved in water

5. Describe what is happening in this process: H2O(l) â†’ H2O(s). Is the process considered a chemical or a physical process? Explain.
	* This is water freezing, or going from a liquid to a solid. This is a physical process describing the physical state

6. Using the flow chart in the model on the previous page to help you, classify each of the following as either a mixture or pure substance. For each substance, tell whether it is an element or a compound. For each mixture, tell whether it is homogeneous or heterogeneous; then list two or more components of the mixture. 
	* a lead weight 
		* Pure Substance
		* Element

	* apple juice
		* mixture
		* homogeneous

	* baking soda
		* Pure substance
		* Compound

	* air
		* mixture
		* homogeneous

	* 14 karat gold ring
		* Pure substance
		* Element

	* 24- karat gold coin
		* Pure substance
		* Element

	* helium in a balloon
		* Pure substance 
		* Element

	* beach sand
		* mixture
		* heterogeneous

	* concrete
		* Mixture
		* homogeneous
	* whole blood
		* ???

	 * carbon dioxide
		 * Pure substance
		 * compound
